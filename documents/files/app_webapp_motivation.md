## Introduction
This document is intended as support for choosing between an app or webapp elaboration of the pinpoint app. Both starting points have their advantages and disadvantages, and it is important to weigh them against each other in order to reach a concrete decision.

The focus is primarily on the technical side of things, which will help a person with little to no knowledge of it-related matters make an informed decision.

## App
An application (app) refers to a software program designed to perform specific tasks or functions on mobile devices like smartphones or tablets. Apps are downloaded from Apple App store or Google Play Store and installed directly onto the device.

### Pros of Apps
- **Performance:** Apps often provide faster performance as they are optimized for specific operating systems and device hardware.
- **Access to Device Features:** They can access various device features like camera, GPS, accelerometer, etc., offering a more integrated user experience.
- **Offline Functionality:** Some apps can work offline, allowing users to access certain features or content without an internet connection.

### Cons of Apps
- **Platform Dependence:** Different operating systems require separate versions of the app (iOS, Android), which may require additional development and maintenance efforts.
- **App Store Approval & Commission:** Apps need approval before being available for download, which might lead to delays or rejections based on the app store's policies. Other than that, making an app available for download on an the app store will not be free of charge (Apple App Store = yearly payment around $100, Google Play Store = One-time fee of around $30).
- **Updates and Storage:** Users need to update apps manually, and apps take up space on the device's storage.

## Webapp
A web application (webapp) is accessed through a web browser over the internet and does not require installation on the user's device. These applications run on remote servers and are accessed through URLs.

### Pros of Webapps
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Webapps can be accessed on various devices regardless of the operating system.
- **No Installation Required:** Users can access a webapp instantly without needing to download or install anything.
- **Easier Updates:** Updates are instant for users as they are implemented on the server-side.

### Cons of Webapps
- **Internet Dependency:** Webapps require a stable internet connection for access and functionality.
- **Limited Device Functionality:** They might have limited access to device features compared to native apps.
- **Performance:** Webapps may have slower performance compared to native apps, especially for complex or resource-intensive tasks.

## Example
Let's say you want to use Facebook. Most-likely, you will grab your phone and navigate to the Facebook app. But, other than simply clicking on the app, you could also go to your webbrowser (Google, Safari, ...) and navigate to Facebook from there. You will notice that the difference between clicking on the app or navigating to Facebook using your browser will result in an almost identic user experience. However, behind the scenes two entirely different applications are running: One being a native app (for phones or tablets, accessible directly from your phone home screen), the other one being a webapp (not device-specific, accessible through webbrowser).

## Summary
Apps and web-apps have distinct advantages and disadvantages, mainly concerning performance, access to device features, internet dependency, and accessibility across platforms. The choice between them often depends on the specific requirements of the user, the features needed, and the intended use case.

## 1. Introduction

The PinPoint app is designed to facilitate the locating of friends and facilities on festival grounds with high accuracy. This document outlines the non-functional requirements that will guide the development and ensure the app delivers a consistent and high-quality user experience across both iOS and Android platforms.

## 2. Performance

- **Response Time**: The app should load within 2 seconds upon opening.
- **Accuracy**: Location tracking should be accurate to within 2 meters, with a goal of reaching sub-meter-level precision where technology permits.
- **Efficiency**: The app should be optimized for battery conservation, not exceeding a 10% decrease in battery life per hour of active use.

## 3. Reliability

- **Availability**: The service should be operational [95%](https://uptime.is/95) of the time during festival hours.
- **Fault Tolerance**: The app must handle standard API error codes gracefully and maintain state during intermittent network failures.
- **Data Recovery**: Users' account should be recoverable in the event of an app crash or unexpected shutdown.

## 4. Usability

- **Intuitiveness**: The app should offer an intuitive interface, allowing new users to navigate and utilize core features without assistance.
- **Consistency**: The app must maintain consistent UI elements across both platforms.
- **Documentation**: User help documentation should be available within the app and online, with a searchable FAQ.

## 5. Compatibility

- **Device Compatibility**: The app must be compatible with phones that support iOS version [latest - 1] and Android version [latest - 1].
- **Screen Sizes**: The app must be responsive and provide a consistent experience across various screen sizes and resolutions.

## 6. Security

- **Accessibility**: Meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards to ensure the app is accessible to all users.

## 8. Maintainability and Support

- **Updates**: Regular updates should be provided, with a major update cycle not exceeding three months.
- **Support**: Provide email support with a response time of less than 48 hours.

## 9. Scalability

- **Load Management**: The app must support up to 10,000 concurrent users without degradation of performance.
- **Database Scalability**: The backend database should be designed to scale horizontally to accommodate growth in user data.

## 10. Localization

- **Languages**: Initially, the app should support English, with plans to include additional languages based on user base demographics.

## 11. Accessibility

- **VoiceOver/Screen Reader Support**: The app must be navigable using VoiceOver on iOS and TalkBack on Android.
- **Contrast**: Text and graphics should have sufficient contrast to be readable in direct sunlight.

## 12. Environmental Considerations

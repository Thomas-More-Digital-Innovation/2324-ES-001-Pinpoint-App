#### Notes

Since this was the first meeting between all involved, we started off with introducing ourselves to each other. Sens and I got to know Ella, the product owner, who introduced herself and passionatly told us about the idea she wants to see realized. We already knew the scrum master Jonas, who graduated as a student Digital Innovation last year. Martijn is Jonas' team lead at Resillion. He will take on a rather passive role as overviewer, since Jonas will mostly take the lead during this project.

The problem Ella wants to tackle is the rather annoying situation at large(r) events or festivals when you lose your friends or don't have a clue where you are exactly. The solution for this consists of two parts: **One way of showing the user his/her location on a custom event map and another way of navigating towards the people you're looking for.**

The given tasks can certainly be realized, but there are some difficulties that we will have to take into account:

* What about indoor events? (connection difficulties)
* Multi-level events (2D -> 3D positioning)
* Only show position to assigned users (data governance)

These are things we have to research, as well as the optimal way of realizing this, but the overall concept is achievable without a doubt. We discussed that since we only have a good 2-3 months (till the end of january) to work on this, we would **focus on creating an MPV**. This way, the project can always be handed over to other students.

With the eyes on next meeting, we asked Ella to really think about how she sees her app used. What happens from the moment the user launches the app? Does a user needs a profile or should it just generate a code (teamviewer)? If she already thinks all these possible uses and scenarios through, we will have a more than solid base to start creating our use case diagram from. We agreed on a meeting next Thursday (2023/11/03), where we will discuss this. Sens and myself attend the meeting at Resillion; Ella will join via a Teams meeting.

#### Project planning & SCRUM

For this project, we will work with **bi-weekly sprints**. At the start of each sprint, we're expected on location on monday afternoon. During this afternoon, we will do the project planning for that specific sprint and spend the remaining hours on-site. At the end of each sprint, we are also expected on-site for a demo, where we can show Ella what we have accomplished. Jonas advised us to be present on-site each monday, but that depends on the schedule and course of business. With daily stand-ups taking place online, this will come down to a **physical presence of 2-3 days each 2 weeks**. In addition to that, a couple of workshops will get organized (no relevance to the project itself), which will gain us an insight in how Resillion operates and what they actually do.

### Conclusion

* Goal: Create an app that allows the user to locate himself on a map & locate others in a crowded area
* Focus on MVP
* Pro-actively think about challenges that may occur during development
* Think about how the app will be used (-> use case diagram)

### Next Steps
* November 2, 2023 - Next meeting with the product owner where we will discuss all the use cases
* November 6, 2023 - Start of first sprint
